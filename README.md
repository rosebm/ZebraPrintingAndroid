Android application that prints using zebra printers.

Below is an image of the test with a Zebra RW420:

NOTE: this is an old project I did when starting coding for Android; since I do not have access anymore to these printers, I cannot make any improvements on the code nor migrate to Kotlin. Nevertheless, hope this works for you as a base.
